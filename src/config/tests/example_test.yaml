# This is an example test file. A quick explanation regarding test files from the README:

# ...Test Configuration - found under `src/test/test<test-num>.yaml`. This file depicts information for
# a specific test. For instance, if one wishes to run a certain algorithm against different num_agents,
# this should be done using a seperate test file. Each test file depicts a series of runs. See
# `src/test/example_test.yaml` for an example of this. This config file overrides all other configurations

# Every test consists of several runs, where each run can consist of a different combination of hyper-parameters.
# This exampple test file shows how to run the multi_particle with changing #agents

# All test files MUST include the 4 following parameters:
num_runs: 5                       # number of runs for this test
env_name: multi_particle          # environment name (as specified in corresponding config in src/config/envs/<env-name>.yaml)
alg_name: lomaq                   # algorithm name (as specified in corresponding config in src/config/algs/<alg_name>.yaml)
override:                         # The parameters that this test overrides

  # If a paramater is in a numerical list of length 2, then the program will assume a series of arithmetic progression [min, max]
  # If a parameter is a list of size "num_tests", it will be looped thorugh
  # In any other case - then it is constant throughout all the runs
  # Parameter name and heirarchy must exist in the config files

  env_args:
    num_agents: [1, 2, 5, 10, 20]  # change the number of agents for every run
